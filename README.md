# BioFeature
this is Kotlin Android code that can be used to prompot the biometric feature on Android devices.
It basically provides all the android security features that your device supports.
I have done extra work of adding flags to it to ensure that the pop up can be monitored and customised to developers liking.
the images below show what to expect when you run this code.

as show in the above images there is allowance for android devices that only have the traditional pattern lock.
